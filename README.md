This is basically my Hello World app to test out [heroku's][heroku] experimental [node.js][node] support.

I normally run my node apps with [kiwi][kiwi] but heroku doesn't support that
currently.  You have to vendor all of your deps in your repo for now.  This app
should be a good starting point for most people.

Running
=======

    % rake
    % node server.js
